Building a predictive model for some ships for Hyundai Heavy Industries . It is one of the world's largest ship manufacturing companies and builds cruise liners.

To calculate the accurate estimates of how many crew members a ship will require. Creating a model and use it to predict how many crew members the ships will need for its next construction.

Here is what the data looks like:

Description: Measurements of ship size, capacity, crew, and age for 158 cruise
ships.


Variables/Columns
Ship Name     1-20
Cruise Line   21-40
Age (as of 2013)   46-48
Tonnage (1000s of tons)   50-56
passengers (100s)   58-64
Length (100s of feet)  66-72
Cabins  (100s)   74-80
Passenger Density   82-88
Crew  (100s)   90-96
Creating a regression model that will help predict how many crew members will be needed for future ships. It is also mentioned that that particular cruise lines will differ in acceptable crew counts.
